        <h2 class="balance-text">How redistricting works now in Rhode Island</h2>
        <div class="leadintro">
          <p>Since 2001 Rhode Island has redistricted using a hybrid commission created by the General Assembly. In 2011 that eighteen (18) member commission included twelve (12) legislators, eight (8) from the Democratic Party and four (4) from the Republican Party. The remaining six (6) members of the commission were drawn from the public, but included a registered lobbyist, and two Democratic Party officials. That commission produced maps (with technical assistance from a consultant hired and paid by the General Assembly) that were then submitted to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
          <p>Other measures of partisan gerrymandering include <a href="https://planscore.org/metrics/partisanbias/">“partisan bias”</a> and <a href="https://planscore.org/metrics/meanmedian/">“mean-median.”</a> d By each of those measures in <a href="https://planscore.org/rhode_island/#!2002-plan-statehouse-eg">2002</a>, <a href="https://planscore.org/rhode_island/#!1992-plan-statehouse-eg">1992</a>, <a href="https://planscore.org/rhode_island/#!1982-plan-statehouse-eg">1982</a>, and <a href="https://planscore.org/rhode_island/#!1972-plan-statehouse-eg">1972</a>, Rhode Island maps suffered from partisan gerrymanders.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rightsupport">
            <h3>The problem</h3>
            <p>Social scientists have produced numerous measures to quantify partisan gerrymandering. The leading measure is known as the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/How_the_Efficiency_Gap_Standard_Works.pdf">“efficiency gap.”</a> It is a measure of number of “wasted votes” that are cast for candidates who did not win, or in excess of the number needed to win for the winning candidate. An <a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1946&context=public_law_and_legal_theory">analysis by Nicholas Stephanopolis and Eric McGee</a> found that using the efficiency gap, Rhode Island’s 2012 House of Representative plan is the most partisan gerrymandered in the United States.</p>

                    <p>In 1981 Senate Majority Leader Rocco Quattrocchi (D-Providence) sought to punish both Republican stalwart Lila Sapinsley (R-Providence) and fellow Democratic “maverick” Senator Richard Licht (D-Providence) by combining their East Side districts. Bucking his party Licht joined Sapinsley in suing to overturn the new districts. When the three-judge panel of the federal court ruled to overturn the maps they wrote, “The only plausible explanation [for the maps are] to preserve the senatorial seats of incumbents favorable to the Democratic leadership and punish incumbents critical of the leadership.”</p>

                    <p>Senator Paul Kelly (D-North Smithfield) was the Majority Leader, the most important position in the state Senate. But just a year after losing that position he found himself on the wrong end of a political gerrymander. His old district contained all of his home community of North Smithfield and part of Woonsocket. Because of gerrymandering he was left with just one-tenth of his former district. The new lines split North Smithfield in half, with the border literally down the middle of the street in front of his house. </p>
